# Antimicro Presets
A compilation of presets for [Antimicro](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro) to control your Linux Desktop, Blender Viewport Controls and more coming soon

## Important
As of writing, Antimcro is deprecated and I just use antimicro installed via linux package manager which seems to be the old version which works on all platforms but please note this project will be updated to use AntimicroX in the near future.

Linux users please use [AntimcroX](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicroX)

Windows users, the build for AntimicroX is not working, for more [info](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro#windows-users) but you can still use the old version
